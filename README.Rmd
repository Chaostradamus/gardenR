The `gardenR` package contains data collected by Lisa Lendway from her vegetable garden in the summer of 2020. The data were used in her Introduction to Data Science course at Macalester College to introduce many concepts. For examples, see the [tutorials for the course](https://ds112-lendway.netlify.app/). 

If you'd like a visual tour of the garden, check it out:

garden_harvest %>% 
  filter(vegetable == "tomatoes") %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(daily_wt_g = sum(weight)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = daily_wt_g)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkred") +
  geom_line(color = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "2020 daily tomato harvest (g)",
       x = "",
